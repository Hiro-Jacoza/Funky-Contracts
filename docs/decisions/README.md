# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Records of finalized architecture and specification decisions for FUNKY smart contracts.

## Rules

1. **Accepted decisions are not re-discussed** unless superseded by a new ADR
2. **Every contract change must have an ADR** before implementation
3. ADRs are submitted via PR and require approval
4. To change a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one

## Status Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → Superseded by ADR-XXXX / Deprecated
```

## How to Create

1. Copy `template.md` → `XXXX-short-title.md`
2. Fill in all fields
3. Submit as PR
4. Get approval → merge → decision is finalized
